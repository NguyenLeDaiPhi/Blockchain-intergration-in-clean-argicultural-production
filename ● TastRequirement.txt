● English: Blockchain integration in clean agricultural production
● Vietnamese: Tích hợp Blockchain trong sản xuất nông sản sạch
● Abbreviation: BICAP
a. Context:
The Blockchain Agricultural Integration Project was launched to address the growing domestic demand for clean and traceable agricultural products. Many small and medium-sized farms and agricultural cooperatives in Vietnam’s agricultural regions face challenges in monitoring, managing production processes, and meeting food safety standards. Additionally, today’s consumers seek clear information about the production processes of the products they consume.

In response to this need, the project leverages Blockchain technology to offer a solution for tracking agricultural product origins from farm to table. With a user-friendly design that easily integrates into existing production workflows, this solution helps farms increase transparency while adapting to the varying production conditions across regions, such as climate and farming practices.

The project aims to foster trust and transparency for consumers while contributing to the sustainable development of Vietnam’s agricultural sector.

b. Proposed Solutions: he project integrates Blockchain in the clean agricultural production process to solve the following problems
● Optimize the monitoring of agricultural production processes.
● Implement product traceability using blockchain technology.
● Provide QR codes to support consumers in checking the origin of agricultural products
● Optimize costs and efficiency through analysis and forecasting.
● Connect farms with retail distributors.
● Functional requirement

o Ship Driver (Mobile App)
• View and view detail of your shipments.
• Update the processes of shipments.
• Scan QR Code to track information of products when completely come farms.
• Confirm that completely to receive products.
• Confirm that completely to give products to retailers.

• Management transportation drivers (Create, Update, Delete, View)
• Send reports to the admin.
• Send notifications to Farm Managements, Retailers.
• View reports from ship Driver.

○ Admin (Web App)
● Admin can create, view, edit, and delete other admin accounts, assigning roles and permissions as needed.
● Admin can view, approve, or reject new farm registrations to ensure legitimacy.
● Admin can access and manage farm details, including certification, contact information, and location.
● Admin can oversee all products registered on the platform, managing product categories, descriptions, and ensuring data accuracy.
● Admin can deploy, update, and manage smart contracts to maintain accuracy and transparency of product tracking data on the blockchain.

○ Guest (Web Application/Mobile App)
● Guest can receive general notifications about the platform, such as new product updates, educational articles, or events related to sustainable agriculture.
● Guest can use search and filter options to easily locate products by criteria like origin, product type, certification, and availability.
● Guest can access articles, videos, and other educational content related to agriculture, sustainable farming practices, and food safety.

● Non-functional requirement:
○ The system should be able to scale flexibly to handle a large number of users and data queries from multiple sources. Components like AWS/Google Cloud, Docker, and Redis should be configured for seamless scaling.
○ The blockchain (VeChainThor) should support multiple concurrent transactions as IoT data volume increases or when product information requests surge.
○ The blockchain must ensure transparency and immutability of product origin data. VeChainThor encryption standards should be used to secure information, with access restricted based on roles (admin, retailer, transporter).
